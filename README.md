# MIPS Processor
This project contains 3 different MIPS processors. Two of them are different types of multicycle processors and one of them is a singlecycle processor. All three were created to run MIPS assembly code. This project was originally managed on my ISU GitLab account, but has now been transferred over to my public GitHub as well.
